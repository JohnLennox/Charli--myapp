            <h3>Website</h3>
            <p>
                I made this website myself (with lots of help from the internet of course) using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
                Prior to making this website I had no real experience with any of these languages, but I had heard about React and decided that it
                was something worth learning. So, I threw myself into the deep end! It was quite difficult to get started since the development process
                felt quite different to what I was used to in other projects I've worked on but it was a valuable learning experience.
                I imagine that the code I wrote isn't the best, but this is an ongoing project, and as I learn more I will go back and update
                things to be better! But, for a first attempt, I'm pretty proud of it!

            <h3>Napier Commission Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                In third year I took a class about Scottish history which was an incredible learning experience, especially since I was born and grew up in Scotland.
                The Napier Commission was set up as a response to the unrest in the Highlands of Scotland due to... a lot of things, but
                the core of the issue was the Highland Clearances. The Napier Commission stood out to me because it is one of the only times
                when we hear from the Gaelic people themselves. After attending the 2024 Digital Humanities Summer Institute course
                on natural language processing, I realized that my programming skills could be used in a humanities context.
                So, I decided that I would do some analysis of the Napier Commission to determine the main concerns of the people.
                We already know that the issues were lack of food, expensive rents, and the stealing of land, but looking at the quantitative analysis
                of the Napier Commission shows just how much the people cared about these things.
                <br></br>
                I want to continue this project in an attempt to analyze how men and women interacted differently with their
                environment.

            <h3>Ocean Networks Canada API</h3>
            <p>
                I participated in the 2024 Digital Humanities Summer Institute course about APIs in Python, and used ONC's API as
                a case study.
                I'm so glad that I decided to attend this course because the idea of APIs was really intimidating to me before.
                Getting into the ONC API was really hard! It is a wonderful service, but it's really hard to start with because there are
                so many possibilities. I managed to get some cool graphs out of it, but it did prove to be quite the process.
